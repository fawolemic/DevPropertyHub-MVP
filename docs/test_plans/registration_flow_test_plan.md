- **Coverage**:
  - Form field validation
  - Integration with shared components
  - Form submission
  - Error handling

### 3. Integration Tests

Integration tests validate the complete user journey and interaction with backend services.

#### Complete Registration Flow
- **Test File**: `integration_test/registration_flow_test.dart`
- **Coverage**:
  - End-to-end developer registration journey
  - End-to-end buyer registration journey
  - End-to-end agent registration journey
  - Navigation between all steps
  - Form submission with mock API
  - Error recovery
  - Success state handling

### 4. Performance Tests

Performance tests ensure the registration flow works efficiently, even with slow connections or on lower-end devices.

#### Load Time and Responsiveness
- **Test File**: `test/performance/registration_performance_test.dart`
- **Coverage**:
  - Form rendering time
  - Navigation transition time
  - File upload performance
  - Memory usage
  - Low bandwidth performance

## Test Environment Setup

### Development Testing

```dart
// Mock providers to simulate API responses
class MockRegistrationService extends Mock implements RegistrationService {}
class MockStorageService extends Mock implements StorageService {}

void main() {
  late MockRegistrationService registrationService;
  late MockStorageService storageService;
  
  setUp(() {
    registrationService = MockRegistrationService();
    storageService = MockStorageService();
  });
  
  // Tests using these mocks...
}
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml (excerpt)
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.10.0'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: flutter test --tags=unit
      - name: Run widget tests
        run: flutter test --tags=widget
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: flutter test integration_test
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: flutter test --coverage
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Test Data

### User Types
- Developer
- Buyer
- Agent

### Form Data
- Valid data sets
- Invalid data sets (for validation testing)
- Edge cases (minimum/maximum values)

### Mock Files
- Valid CAC certificates (PDF, JPG)
- Invalid files (wrong format, oversized)

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Pre-commit Tests**: Run unit and widget tests before committing code
2. **CI Pipeline Tests**: Run all tests on pull requests
3. **Manual Testing**: Perform exploratory testing on complex flows
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate with stakeholders

## Test Reporting

- **Coverage Reports**: Generated after test runs
- **Test Execution Summary**: Display pass/fail counts
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Compare UI snapshots

## Defect Management

1. **Reporting**: Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior
2. **Prioritization**: Critical (blocking), High (major functionality), Medium (minor issues), Low (cosmetic)
3. **Tracking**: Use GitHub issues with appropriate labels

## Conclusion

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality and reliability of the DevPropertyHub registration flow. By following this plan, we can deliver a robust user experience while maintaining code quality and performance.
